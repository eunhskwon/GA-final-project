Project Idea 1: Redesign With Warm Welcome's homepage/ major pages
https://withwarmwelcome.com/

The current design seems too templated and "blocky," with little hierarchy and personality. I would like to redesign the page to look and feel literally more welcoming and warm, as the group's name.

To work on:

1. Header takes up too much of the vh, giving less space for the viewers to browse through the site.

2. While the video is a nice touch, the aspect ratio doesn't allow it to be appreciated. It also takes away from the main message, which should be the message underneath.

3. Podcast, Projects, and Posters sections are boring and have little character

4. Projects tab — maybe have them visible together, portfolio style, instead of projects only being visible when clicked one at a time?

5. Podcast — hierarchy off, text too big, width of the content too large. Overall hard to see content. Columns? Overall just width and sizing adjustment?


*TBD if I have time to work on multiple pages, or just the homepage.

**Questions for the instructors:

•Is it possible for coded templates to be uploaded/ used in templated sites such as Squarespace?

•Not a coding question, but do you know if it's possible to have the rest of the functions from these providers (i.e. Squarespace, Wordpress, etc) where the teammates who don't know can still plug and save, and the content gets pushed while the look and feel is still from the coded?

•Overall, how do people still have it be hosted(?) in providers while customizing/ uploading their own overall template?





Project Idea 2: Photo album of sorts to display photos from travel

For fun, to reminisce on the good times when we could travel. And also to share photos with friends


1. Homepage

2. Portfolio-style, cities/ locations visible wtih previews and interactive elements, like images or text moving/ changing when hovering over

3. Have images react when hovering/ clicking, instead of a single simple carousel for each city

*This would be more of a visual/ animation challenge than functionality
